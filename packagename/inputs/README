This folder can be used to place inputs that may be expected by the project.
                                                                                                                                                              
Obviously the project could be configured to look for input data in an external
folder as well, but placing it inside the package has its benefits, e.g.
enabling one to create a standalone python-executable zipfile which contains the
data required already.
                                                                                                                                                              
Note that this folder is simply a convention. If you plan to use it, you should
reflect this in your CONFIG.py file appropriately as well!

Note: We have included a trivial data.csv file here as an example (which
also allows the template to run without errors).
