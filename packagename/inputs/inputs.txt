This folder can be used to place inputs that may be expected by the project.

Obviously this could be an external folder as well, but placing it inside the package has its benefits, e.g. enabling
one to create a standalone python-executable zipfile which contains the data required already.

Make sure to edit the CONFIG.ME file appropriately as well!

Note: We have included a trivial data.csv file here as an example, which allows the template to run without errors.
