This folder can contain any extra documentation that is not covered in the
project's README file.

In particular, it can be used as the place to put all docstrings as separate
textfiles, and import them from the relevant modules, to avoid having to clutter
the source code with long docstrings that are 'user' oriented, keeping the
source code focused on 'implementation' comments and documentation.

Recommended filenames for docstringsare packagename.__doc__ for the package
itself and packagename.src.modulename.__doc__ for all others, such that the
names reflect the respective modules to which they refer.
                                                                           
An example packagename.__doc__ is provided here; note how this is used from
within the package's __init__.py file.
