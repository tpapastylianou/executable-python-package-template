This is the documentation for package 'packagename'.
It is imported by the __init__ file during first import and used as the
package's docstring.

In a real project this would be detailed documentation relating to the project
and syntax, that goes beyond the scope of the package's README file.

Keeping documentation here instead of placing it at the top of the __init__ file
(and on the top of modules as long strings more generally) has several
advantages:

- All documentation is kept in one, standard, easily searchable (i.e. grep)
  location.
- Code is uncluttered by long docstrings at the start of the
  file, and can focus on more practical comments and explanations relating to
  the 'implementation', without cluttering the sources with things that relate
  to 'usage'.
- The doc folder may contain other kinds of documentation beyond docstrings,
  such as interactive notebooks, demos, etc.
