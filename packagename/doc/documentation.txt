This folder can contain any extra documentation that is not covered in the
project's README file.

In particular, it can be used as the place to put all docstrings as separate
textfiles, and import them from the relevant modules, to avoid having to clutter
the source code with long docstrings that are 'user' oriented, keeping the
source code focused on 'implementation' comments and documentation.

See packagename.txt in the same folder for an example, and note how this is
used from within the package's __init__.py file.
