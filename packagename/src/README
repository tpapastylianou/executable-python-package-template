This is the folder where all project-defined modules / submodules are defined.

In an ideal project, the package's '__main__' module should only contain
high-level / top-down instructions, in effect looking more like a table of
contents to the different steps followed by the program, where these are
implemented as calls to the appropriate modules defined here.


Modules defined here can further be divided into two categories:

 - 'utility' modules: modules that effectively serve as a logical grouping /
   container for related functions

 - 'functional' modules: modules that are responsible for a single step of the
   algorithm, reflected by that module's 'run' function, and intended to be run
   as a unit, rather than as serving as a repository of related functions.


Typically these can be informally differentiated by the nature of their names:

'Utility' modules are named after nouns that describe their utility, e.g.
'graphics_utilities', 'db_utilities' etc.

Whereas 'functional' modules are named after their 'role', e.g. 'reportCreator'
(i.e. calling this module by its 'run' function will create the report),
'dataPreprocessor' (calling this module will preprocess the data in a prescribed
manner), etc.
