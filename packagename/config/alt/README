## This folder stores 'alt' (i.e. alternative) configuration files, which
## could be used to override the default CONFIG.py file contained in the
## parent directory. These may represent backups, templates, etc.
##
## This may be a useful thing to have, e.g. if the package represents an
## experiment, and one might want to run the experiment under a different
## configuration than the default.
##
## The approach used in the current template, is to have the __init__.py react
## to the presence of an optional '--config' option, taking a config file as an
## argument. In the presence of this option, configuration options are read from
## the specified config file, otherwise the default CONFIG.py file of the parent
## folder is used.
## As an example, the ALT_CONFIG.py file contained in this folder could be run
## by running the package as follows:
##
##     python3 -m packagename --config packagename/config/alt/ALT_CONFIG.py
##
##
## However, there are other ways in which such a folder could be used. E.g. if
## you don't like having to pass commandline options, you could simply treat the
## default CONFIG.py file of the parent folder as a symbolic link to one of the
## alternative configurations contained in this folder. In this way, one can
## simply 'change' configurations by updating the symbolic link to point to the
## desired config file in this directory, as appropriate.
