## This folder stores the project's main configuration file, CONFIG.py, which
## should be edited by hand.
##
## CONFIG.py is intended to be edited by hand, and act as a normal python module
## defining variables in python syntax, which are to be imported by the package
## at initialization time
##
## Note that this 'importing' is not automatic; the package's __init__ file
## needs to be manually written so as to correspond to the contents of the
## intended config file correctly, importing / processing the expected config
## variables appropriately.
##
## Optionally, this folder can also hold backups, templates, or alternative
## configs that can be chosen instead of the default CONFIG.py file. See
## the contained 'alt' directory for details.
