v1.0.3: - Modified template, to make it run without errors, producing nominal
          output.
        - Fixed bugs (dataPresenter renamed to reportCreator)
        - Implemented trivial but standalone example of a reportCreater,
          outputting to a jupyter notebook.
        - Improved unit testing template, and made compatible with runnable
          nature of the rest of the template.
        - Example of design-by-contract methodology, with appropriate tests.
------

v1.0.2: - Added a ChangeLog to project structure (you're currently reading

          (Test_ -> Test_run_mcmc)
------
