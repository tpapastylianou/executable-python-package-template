## This is an example of a pip requirements file, of the kind typically
## generated by `pip3 freeze`.
##
## More generally, a requirements file is simply a straightforward way to
## declare pypi dependencies for a project, which can be installed on the system
## using a simple `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command. Obviously for very
## simple dependencies, providing a requirements file may be overkill, and they
## can simply be stated in the project's README file instead.
##
## However, more specifically, sometimes projects require specific versions of
## packages to be installed on the system, rather than just the latest version
## of a package. This is e.g. particularly important in terms of
## reproducibility, such as when packages are intended to represent
## self-contained 'experiments', etc. In such a case, it makes sense to provide
## a requirements.txt file here, along with instructions in the project's README
## on how to use it (e.g. possibly also detailing how to set up a suitable
## python virtual environment for the experiment).
##
## Note: The package's directory structure also contains a 'lib' directory,
## intended for non-pip dependencies.
