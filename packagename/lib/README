This (optional) folder contains any external libraries that are required to be
packaged within the project (e.g. dependencies that are typically not dealt with
by simply installing them externally on the user's system through pip).

Typical scenarios might include:

 - Stray, third-party python modules
 - Libraries from other languages that will be interfaced with in the main
   source code (which typically might need some form of compilation or
   initialization first).
